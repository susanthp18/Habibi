# Contributing

This repository is edited by both humans and agents. The durable rule is simple:
keep system code, generic plugins, task templates, complete examples, and real
task projects physically separate.

## Read First

- `AGENTS.md` is the machine-friendly repository contract.
- `docs/concepts/architecture.md` is the active architecture overview.
- `docs/index.md` is the source documentation entry.

## Default Change Flow

1. Identify whether the change belongs to core, a generic plugin, a task template,
   a complete example, an external task project, tests, docs, or operator scripts.
2. Make the smallest change that fits the existing boundary.
3. Add or update tests at the same boundary.
4. Rebuild docs when docstrings or docs changed.
5. Record high-risk architectural implementation context in the commit or
   pull-request description.

## Stable Docstrings

Public and semi-public Python APIs use Google-style docstrings. A docstring
should describe the contract that future callers can rely on, not the history of
one bug fix.

Use comments for non-obvious invariants, recovery behavior, and failure policy.
Do not add comments that only restate the next line of code.

## Default Verification

```bash
uv sync --group dev --extra docs
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -q
uv run python scripts/run_test_coverage.py unit --fail-under 90 --fail-under-statements 95
uv run python scripts/run_test_coverage.py integration
uv run python -m compileall -q praxist tests templates examples scripts
uv run python scripts/build_docs_site.py
git diff --check
```

Narrow changes can start with narrow tests, but the default handoff should still
include the full suite above.

The coverage command writes ignored local reports under `cover/unit/` and
`cover/integration/`. The `unit` profile is the offline non-integration test
layers and is held at 90% branch-aware total coverage plus 95% statement
coverage; the `integration` profile is `tests/integration` and remains
observational. It uses `coverage.py` from the dev dependency group and keeps the
test runner on `unittest`.

## What Requires Extra Care

Extra care is required when changing startup, plugin resolution, task path
resolution, credential selection, runtime invocation, prompt layout, event-driven
peer scheduling, finding graph guidance, budget policy, replay verification, or
run artifact schemas.

Those changes should include focused tests and, when they change architecture
contracts, a concise rationale in the pull-request description.
